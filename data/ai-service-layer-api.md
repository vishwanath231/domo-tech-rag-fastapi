> Domo's AI Service Layer enables developers to build AI capabilities into their Domo Apps. In particular, the AI Service Layer currently supports two services from within Apps:

1.  Text Generation
2.  Text-to-SQL
3.  Image-to-Text
    Domo allows you to configure which models power each of the services. For more on how that works, [see this video](https://www.youtube.com/live/f4L7bc52snE?feature=share&t=549).
    You can also see example usage of the the Text Generation and the Text-to-SQL in the AI Domo Bricks currently available to download for free in the Domo AppStore.

### [

Text Generation
](#text-generation)
Generates a text response from a text prompt.

#### [

Code Example
](#code-example)
The `body` variable in this post request is an example of a sample request body.
const prompt \= 'Tell me a joke about data.';
const body \= {
input: prompt,
};
domo
.post(\`/domo/ai/v1/text/generation\`, body)
.then((response) \=> console.log(response));
Arguments
](#arguments)
Property Name
Type
Required
Description
input
String
The prompt you are sending to the model
promptTemplate
Object
Optional
An override for the prompt template used in the service. It has one property `template`, which expects a string.
parameters
Used with the `promptTemplate` for additional customization. You can pass any key, value pair of strings. See examples below.
model
The id of the model you'd like to use if you don't want to use the default model.
HTTP Request
](#http-request)
POST /domo/ai/v1/text/generation HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Request Body
](#request-body)
The only required field in the request body is the `input` string, but you can provide additional properties in the request body to futher customize the text generation service. If you choose to use the `promptTemplate` property to override the default prompt template, you'll need to use `${input}` into the template string to pass through the input of your prompt.
{
"input": "Recap the 2021 superbowl",
"promptTemplate": {
"template": "${input}. You are a helpful assistant that gives answers in ${max\_words} words or less"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "max\_words": "30"
  "model": "8dc5737d-0bc8-425b-ad0d-5d6ec1a99e72"
}
HTTP Response
](#http-response)
Returns the prompt used and the responses from the model. If the a model was specified in the request, then `modelId` will return the model and `isCustomerModel` will be true.
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF\-8
    "prompt": "Recap the 2021 superbowl",
    "choices": \[

    "modelId": "8dc5737d-0bc8-425b-ad0d-5d6ec1a99e72",
    "isCustomerModel": true
Text-to-SQL
](#text-to-sql)
Generates a SQL query based on a prompt and a DataSet's schema.
](#code-example-1)
const exampleDataSourceSchema \= {
  dataSourceName: 'Sales',
  description: 'Sales Data',
  columns: \[
    {
      name: 'Date',
      type: 'date',
    },
      name: 'Sales',
      type: 'number',
  \],
  input: 'Show me the sales for the last 3 months.',
  dataSourceSchemas: \[exampleDataSourceSchema\],
  .post(\`/domo/ai/v1/text/sql\`, body)
](#arguments-1)
dataSourceSchemas
Array of Objects
The schemas of datasets that they service should take into account when generating the SQL query from the input prompt.
](#http-request-1)
POST /domo/ai/v1/text/sql HTTP/1.1
](#request-body-1)
  "input": "Create a sql query to show me total sales.",
    "template": "${input}. Show me the ${measure} for the last ${timeframe}"

](#code-example-2)
export async function imageToText(base64) {
  // Example: OCR request body for AI API
  // Remove data URL prefix if present
  let pureBase64 \= base64;
  if (pureBase64.startsWith('data:')) {
    pureBase64 \= pureBase64.substring(pureBase64.indexOf(',') + 1);
  }

const response \= await fetch('/domo/ai/v1/image/text', {
