Data Prep & Analysis
](#data-prep--analysis)

- [**AI Readiness**](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005561?language=en_US): To get the most value from Domo.AI, we recommend preparing your data using AI Readiness. AI Readiness is available in the Details view of every DataSet in the Data Center.
- [**AI Chat**](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005539?language=en_US): Domo.AI Chat lets you talk with your data from inside Domo using a familiar chat interface. AI Chat is context-aware, referencing DataSets and cards hosted either by an App Studio app or by the dashboard you are currently viewing. You can access a detailed breakdown of each step the model took to answer your question, and AI Chat also suggests additional questions to help you go deeper. AI Chat is session-specific, storing chats from past sessions that you can view in the chat history. See a [live demo](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUpEM9VZUFg?si=qA_2jsEzBR6FRyl6&t=185) or [tips for using AI Chat](https://www.youtube.com/live/hUpEM9VZUFg?t=857s). _Note: AI Chat is currently available for all consumption customers_

- [**Domo.AI Playground**](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005236?language=en_US): Domo.AI Playground allows you to try out various generative AI services within the Domo environment. The following services are available:
  - Text-to-SQL: The service generates SQL queries based on your instructions and the dataset you select. You can also access Text-to-SQL within Jupyter Workspaces ([live demo](https://www.youtube.com/live/f4L7bc52snE?si=fOK6HoTpAQUpl9t0&t=900)).
  - Text-to-Beast-Mode: The service generates Beast Mode formulas based on your instructions and the dataset you select.
  - Text Generation: Enter a question and the service returns an answer.
  - Text Summarization: Enter text and the service generates a summary of the text.
  - [**Forecasting**](https://domo-support.domo.com/s/article/000005567?language=en_US#forecasting_in_aiplayground): Generate a forecast based on the data you provide and the configurations you set--no need to build a forecasting model from scratch. You can also extract the cURL code that generates the forecast and use the code in other settings, including an API. _Note: This service is currently in Alpha. Please contact your AE or CSM to get access._
- [**ResponsibleGPT App**](https://www.domo.com/appstore/app/responsiblegpt-app/overview): The ResponsibleGPT App allows for a safe and secure generative AI experience within your Domo environment, enabling users to ask business questions directly to ResponsibleGPT without worrying about data leaks.
